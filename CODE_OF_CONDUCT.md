This is a temporary Code of Conduct. We expect to adopt the same as the NixOS
Foundation once one is selected there.

On the high level, we expect members and contributors to behave like adults,
with a keen interest in technology and respect of each other. Please try to
take into account that we all have different sensibilities, and that it's a
human that will read your message on the other side.

As the moderation team, we recognize that a project is composed of both
technology, and people. Our role is to help maintain a balance in the
project so that we can work together, despite our differences.

To report spam, report misbehaviour, or even just seek guidance on how to deal
with a situation, please contact
[admin@nix-community.org](mailto:admin@nix-community.org). If the conflict is
with one of the admins, feel free to reach out directly to the other members.

## Escalation policy

Everybody can have a bad day, but try not to make it other people's bad day.

We try to give people the benefit of the doubt and will generally first issue
a warning, then temporary ban, then permanent ban if necessary.
